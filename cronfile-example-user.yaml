# Be sure to run yaml-to-systemd <file> when this file is modified.
#
# Defaults and shortcuts are defined in yaml-to-systemd and can be set in this
# file as well. The relevant keys are
#   "shortcuts", "exec_pre", "timer_defaults", "service_defaults",
#   "unit_header", "systemd_dir", "systemctl_cmd", "dry_run"
# Keys "shortcuts", "timer_defaults", "service_defaults" extend the defaults in
# yaml-to-systemd while keys "exec_pre", "unit_header", "systemd_dir",
# "systemctl_cmd", "dry_run" override them.
#
# Time specification is given in man systemd.time.
#
# All top-level keys support array assignment, in which case the block is
# *-expanded. For example, {a: [b, c], d: e} yields {a:b, d:e} and {a:c, d:e}.
